# Ontario-COVID-19-Tableau

INTRODUCTION
- In Canada particularly in Ontario, the COVID-19 Cases are on a rise. Ontario’s Premier Doug Ford declared a second state of emergency and issued a stay-at-home order for the province, which started on Jan 14, 2021.
- The latest headline states that Ontario reports a single-day increase in new COVID-19 cases, records more than 3,400 infections

DATASET
- The dataset source is https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario
- The data is actually quite extensive but it is missing a lot of values. 
- A couple of abbreviations that have been used in data are LTC ie Long Term Care and HCW, Health care workers. 
- The data was pulled from Ontario’s public health website on January 16, 2021 so it only includes data from January 26, 2020 to January 16, 2021.

PREPROCESSING
- I first preprocessed the data and the preprocessed data file is found in this Github repository.

VISUALIZATIONS
- I build a few dashboards in Tableau using this preprocessed dataset.

DASHBOARD -1
- The above dashboard highlights that in Ontario the total cases, as well as positive COVID-19 cases, have been on a rise since September 2020. 
- The total number of cases were less than 500 in early fall have now risen to 3000 cases per day. 
- There was a sharp increase in November following the Thanksgiving weekend. 
- The case rose again in the new year to an all-time high. This is probably because people celebrated Christmas in person.

DASHBOARD -2
- The above dashboard further confirms that the COVID-19 cases are on a rise since Thanksgiving in October. 
- The number of patients hospitalized and patients in ICU on a ventilator due to COVID-19 are at an all-time high in the new year. 
- The COVID -19 positive cases, as well as deaths, are on a rise in long term care facilities as well since December 2020.

DASHBOARD -3
- The above bar graph shows that most of the cases get resolved quickly. 
- The highest cases were in the last quarter of 2020, that's probably because the data on the first quarter of January is only until January 16, 2021.

CONCLUSIONS
- COVID-19 cases in Ontario are on an all-time high after Christmas in person celebrations. 
- This is very well evident by the daily patient count, the increasing number of patients in the ICU, and the positive cases in Long Term Care facilities. 
- Aggressive measurements need to be taken to flatten the curve before it gets out of control.
